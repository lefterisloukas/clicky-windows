# Clicky Windows

AI-powered screen companion for Windows. See your screen, hear your voice, point at answers.

Windows companion to [farzaa/clicky](https://github.com/farzaa/clicky) (macOS).

## What it does

- **Sees your screen** — captures screenshots and sends them to Claude with vision
- **Hears you** — push-to-talk voice input with real-time transcription
- **Speaks back** — text-to-speech responses via ElevenLabs, OpenAI, or Windows SAPI
- **Points at things** — animated cursor overlay that highlights UI elements Claude references
- **Cursor buddy** — persistent blue glowing dot that follows your mouse (toggleable)
- **Always on top** — optional pinned chat window that stays visible over other apps
- **Multi-provider** — supports Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter (300+ models), Google Gemini, OpenCode Go, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Custom)
- **HIPAA mode** — force all processing local (transcription + TTS) except the LLM call
- **Lives in your tray** — runs quietly as a system tray app

## Download

### Installer (recommended)

Download the latest **Clicky-Setup.exe** from [Releases](https://github.com/tekram/clicky-windows/releases). Double-click to install — no dependencies needed.

### Build from source

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tekram/clicky-windows.git
cd clicky-windows
npm install
npx tsc
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** `npm run dev` does not compile TypeScript for you. You must run `npx tsc` before the first launch and after every source change, or run `npx tsc --watch` in a second terminal.

### Build a distributable installer

```bash
npx tsc
npm run make
```

The installer will be in `out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/Clicky-Setup.exe`.

## Setup

1. Launch Clicky (or run `npm run dev`)
2. Open **Settings** from the system tray icon
3. Enter your API key(s):
   - **Required:** [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (or use OpenRouter/OpenAI)
   - **Optional:** [Groq](https://console.groq.com/) for voice transcription (default STT provider)
   - **Optional:** [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) for real-time voice transcription
   - **Optional:** [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) for premium TTS

## Features

### Voice Input

Hold the push-to-talk hotkey (default: `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) to record, release to send. Transcription providers:
- **Groq Whisper** — cloud, very fast, free tier, default
- **AssemblyAI** — cloud, real-time streaming, high accuracy
- **OpenAI Whisper** — cloud, fast
- **Whisper Local** — offline, private (uses whisper.cpp)

### Text-to-Speech

- **Windows SAPI** — free, offline, works out of the box
- **OpenAI TTS** — cloud, natural sounding
- **ElevenLabs** — cloud, premium quality

### Cursor Buddy

A persistent blue glowing dot that follows your mouse cursor — similar to the Mac version's blue cursor overlay. Toggle on/off in **Settings > Window > "Cursor buddy"**. Enabled by default.

### AI Pointing

When Claude references UI elements on your screen, it uses `[POINT]` tags to animate a cursor overlay that highlights exactly what it's talking about. Works across multi-monitor setups.

### HIPAA Mode

Toggle in Settings to force all processing to stay local:
- Transcription: local Whisper (no audio leaves device)
- TTS: Windows SAPI (no text leaves device)
- Only the LLM API call goes external (requires BAA with Anthropic)

## Relation to macOS Clicky

This is a Windows-native reimplementation of [farzaa/clicky](https://github.com/farzaa/clicky). The macOS version uses Swift/SwiftUI with ScreenCaptureKit — APIs that don't exist on Windows. This version uses Electron + TypeScript to provide the same experience on Windows.

**Shared concepts:** POINT tag protocol, conversation flow, cursor buddy overlay, proxy worker architecture.
**Different:** Everything else (language, framework, system APIs).
